# Personal Git Repo

This repository contains a lot of the things that help me in my day-to-day life
as a college student.

## config-files

This folder contains dotfiles and config files that I use on my machine.

## templates

Templates that I have to copy when I need to do a routine task.

## Programming practice

This folder contains multiple random things that may or may not be important. Tons of little pieces of code that I have made for practice. Contains multiple scripts that I have made over the years. They
may or may not be optimal, however I keep them around as a personal reference
just in case.


## health 

Anytime I have time to write up on some health and fitness related things I'll put it in here.
