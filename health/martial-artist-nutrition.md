# Nutrition for the Martial Artist

When taking weight classes into consideration, the martial artist should walk at about 20 pounds above their fighting weight.

## Meals per Day 

- A martial artist with multiple training sessions per day must eat six meals per day, instead of the normal three meals a day.
- Cook multiple meals' worth of food every time you cook. 
- You should consume a meal replacement or meal recovery shake once or twice per day. (This is especially true for people who struggle with gaining weight).


## Meal Timing

- Eating every 3 to 4 hours
