# Nutrition for the Martial Artist

When taking weight classes into consideration, the martial artist should walk at
about 20 pounds above their fighting weight.

## Meals per Day

- A martial artist with multiple training sessions per day must eat six meals per day, instead of the normal three meals a day.
- Cook multiple meals' worth of food every time you cook.
- You should consume a meal replacement or meal recovery shake once or twice per day. (This is especially true for people who struggle with gaining weight).

## Meal Timing

- Eating every 3 to 4 hours
- Do not let yourself get too hungry, let you risk over eating.

## Mixing Proteins, Fats, and Carbohydrates

- The Glycemic Index (GI) ranks a food according to how fast it raises blood-sugar levels.
- The warrior should not be eating only one energy source at a time.
- We should be concerned more with the Glycemic Load of the food rather than the glycemic index.
- Adding different proportions of foods with varying glycemic indices lowers the total glycemic load.

## Meal Quality

- Your opponent is eating well, make sure you do too.
- Pick _nutrient dense foods_.
- Examples of nutrient dense foods:
  - Lean organic meats
  - Fish from known origins
  - Organic fruits and vegetables (Vary the colors as much as you can)

## Potential Allergies

- Make sure to understand what you are allergic to.
- If you get sick, your body will expound its energy in attempts to return to homeostasis.


# Warrior Lifestyle Control Points 

## Sleep
- Sleep is more important than you think. 
- Everyone needs different amounts of sleep. 
- 45 Minutes is the minimum amount of time to go through all sleep cycles.
- 6 hours is the minimum amount of time required, but is not recommended.
- 7.5 - 9 hours is the recommended during training.

If you are not getting enough sleep:
- You will not be able to fully repair damage caused by your workouts.
- Your horomonal levels will get thrown off.
- You will be hungrier.

**If you are not sleeping well, you will not train as well, and you will be hungrier, so make sure to sleep well.**

- Your body perceives lack of sleep as a stressful situation, so cortisol is increased, which breaks down muscle tissue.


## Supplementation
- Multivitamins are a great way to get necessary nutrients for low amounts of calories (instead of relying on the body to use muscles for nutrients).
- Antioxidants (15 mg of lutein) are a great way to not only retain eyesight, but also 'mop up free radicals'
- It is recommended to consume anti-catabolic with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA's)(beef, poultry, whey protien), glutamine(raw spinach, raw parsley, cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, milk, yogurt, beef, pork, and poultry), and something to help with cortisol.
- Meal Replacement shakes


# Meal Plans
Typically, these are good macros:
- Carbohydrates: 5-8 g/kg of body weight/day. 
- Protein: 1.2 - 1.7 g/kg of body weight/day.
- Fat: the rest of the calories, but from heart-healthy sources.
