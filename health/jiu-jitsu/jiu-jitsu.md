# Jiu Jitsu

## Positions

- Back Mount
  - Most advantageous position the attacker can maintain since the human body is
    relatively incapable of defending itself from attacks from the rear. Back
    control usually means you have your "hooks" in the opponents legs or have a
    body triangle wrapped around the opponent's waist with your own legs.
- Full Mount
  - Most advantageous position the attacker can maintain while the opponent
    faces you. In this position, the attacker has both of their legs past the
    legs of the opponent. Thus allowing complete attack opportunities to the
    arms and the neck of the opponent.
- Side Control
  - In this position, the attacker is past the opponents legs, but has not
    placed their own legs on top of the opponent's torso. While still a great
    position that allows multiple attacks, it is imperative that the attacker
    pressure a submission, or transition to a better control position.
- Full Guard
  - In this position, the opponent has both of their legs available to defend
    attacks from you. In 'closed' full guard, the opponent has their legs
    wrapped around you. In 'open' full guard, the opponent does not have their
    legs wrapped around you, and thus creates space for you, the attacker.
- Half Guard
  - In half guard, the opponent and yourself each have one leg past the each
    other's leg. This position is the most equal position when considering
    attack and defense opportunities for both the defender and attacker.
- Turtle
  - In this position, the defender is on all fours while the attacker is usually
    standing or on their knees, on top of the defender. This position is not
    advantageous for the defender, specifically in MMA because of the allowance
    of strikes. In addition, there are many threats for submissions and control
    positions from the attacker such as a head and arm choke, back control or a
    sneaky submission.

## Submissions

Submissions cause the opponent to surrender to your attack. I will include
common submissions that are fairly reliable in a no-gi/mma setting.

- Blood Chokes: These cause the opponent to lose blood circulation by crushing
  the two carotid arteries or crushing the trachea of the opponent, causing them
  to pass out.

  - Rear Naked Choke (RNC)
    - This submission involves cutting circulation from the head by strangling
      the opponent using your arms. The attacker grabs their own bicep and
      squeezes the defender's two carotid arteries.
  - Triangle Choke
    - In this submission, the attacker wraps their legs around the neck and one
      arm of the defender. This allows the leg of the attacker and the arm of
      the defender to be used to squeeze the defender's carotid arteries and
      strangle the defender.
  - Arm Triangle
    - In this submission, the opponent wraps their arms around the neck and one
      arm of the defender and grabs their own bicep. This allows the attacker to
      use their shoulder and the arm of the defender to crush the carotid
      arteries and strangle the defender.
  - Head and Arm Choke
    - Anaconda
      - In this submission, the attacker wraps their arms around the neck and
        one arm of the defender. The attacker grabs their own bicep at the
        defender's arm pit and uses control to choke the opponent from there.
    - Darce
      - Similar to the Anaconda, the attacker wraps their arms around the neck
        and one arm of the defender. However, in the Darce variation, the
        attacker grabs their own bicep at the defender's neck and uses control
        to choke the opponent from there.
    - Guillotine
      - In this submission, the attacker wraps their arms around the neck of the
        defender and attacks the trachea. This stops air flow into the lungs to
        force the submission.

- Joint Locks: These cause pressure on the joints, resulting in torn ligaments.
  - Armbar
    - In this submission, the attacker uses their crotch to hyper extend the arm
      of the defender. This submission can be attacked from multiple positions
      such as full guard and full mount.
  - Kimura
    - In this submission, the attacker locks the arm of the opponent and twists
      the defender's arm to cause pain to the defender's rotator cuff in the
      shoulder. The twisting motion happens from the front of the body, below
      the shoulder, and continued until a submission is forced.
  - Americana
    - Similar to the Kimura, the attacker locks the arm of the opponent and
      twist the defender's arm to cause pain to the defender's rotator cuff in
      the shoulder. However, in the Americana variation, the twisting motion
      happens from the front of the body and above the shoulder until the
      submission is forced. This submission happens at a sooner point in than
      the Kimura, however, it is often harder to control the opponent when
      executing this submission.
  - Omoplata
    - In this submission, the attacker uses their legs to lock the arm of the
      defender and twist the arm in the same direction as the Kimura to force
      the submission.
  - Wrist Lock
    - In this submission, the defender's hand is pushed towards their own arm 
  - Ankle Lock
  - Heel Hook
  - Toe Hold
  - Knee Bar
